# Residency Weekend Project (04/04/2025-04/06/2025)
# Expense Tracker Application
## Advanced Programming Languages : MSCS-632
- Instructor: Dr. Vanessa Cooper
   
    University of the Cumberlands
## Group-1

## Overview
A CLI-based expense tracker built in both Python and C++ to demonstrate language-specific features.

## Core Features
- Add/View expenses
- Filter (by date, category)
- Summary view (by category and total)

## Python Design
- Data: List of dictionaries
- Modules: datetime/panda, json
- Dynamic typing, simple I/O

## C++ Design
- Data: vector,list
- STL usage: chrono,fstream,iostream, string
  
## Anticipated Challenges
- In C++ :
1. Date Parsing with chrono
2. Input Validation
3. Testing with GoogleTest

- In Python :
1. Dynamic typing in Python
2. Date parsing with datetime.strptime()
3. Manual testing was time consuming

## Team Roles
- Avinna â€“ Python functions
- Peera - C++ functions
- Pabitra - Helping on commenting for the code, report writing/documentation for all phases
- Anna & Mariam - PowerPoint Presentation (drafting and presenting)

## How to Run the Expense Tracker Application

### Python 

- **Ensure Python is installed:**
You must have Python installed on your system. You can check this by running: `python --version`
  
- **Navigate to Python directory:**  
`cd python`

- **Run the unit tests:**
To verify that the core functionality works as expected, run: `python test_expense_tracker.py`

- **Run the Expense Tracker application:**
To start the CLI-based expense tracker: `python mainmenu_expense_tracker.py`

### C++
